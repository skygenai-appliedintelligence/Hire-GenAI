# Quick Fix Summary: Real OpenAI Costs

## 🎯 Problem
The `cv_parsing_usage` table (and other usage tables) were storing **fixed mock prices** (`$0.50` per CV) instead of **real OpenAI API costs**.

## ✅ Solution

### 1. Run Database Migration
```bash
psql $DATABASE_URL < migrations/fix_cv_parsing_usage_real_costs.sql
```

This adds new columns to track real costs:
- `openai_base_cost` - Real cost from OpenAI API
- `pricing_source` - 'openai-api' or 'fallback'
- `tokens_used` - Actual tokens consumed
- `profit_margin_percent` - Margin applied (25%)

### 2. Code Already Updated
✅ `lib/database.ts` - All 3 methods now store real costs
✅ `lib/openai-usage-tracker.ts` - Centralized tracker already created

### 3. How It Works Now

**Before (Mock)**:
```
unit_price: $0.50 (fixed)
cost: $0.50 (fixed)
source: unknown
```

**After (Real)**:
```
openai_base_cost: $0.0045 (real from OpenAI API)
cost: $0.0057 (real + 25% margin)
pricing_source: 'openai-api'
tokens_used: 1500
```

## 🧪 Test It

1. **Upload a CV** or **generate questions**
2. **Check console logs**:
   ```
   ✅ [CV-PARSING] SUCCESS: Real OpenAI cost fetched!
   💰 OpenAI Base Cost: $0.0045
   💵 Final Cost (with margin): $0.0057
   🏷️  Source: openai-api
   ```
3. **Check database**:
   ```sql
   SELECT openai_base_cost, cost, pricing_source, tokens_used
   FROM cv_parsing_usage 
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 1;
   ```

## 📊 Verify on Billing Page

Visit: `http://localhost:3000/dashboard/settings/billing?tab=usage`

Should now show:
- ✅ Real costs from OpenAI API
- ✅ Real vs fallback breakdown
- ✅ Accurate per-operation costs

## 🔍 Quick Verification Query

```sql
-- Check if real costs are being stored
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN pricing_source = 'openai-api' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as real_api,
  SUM(CASE WHEN pricing_source = 'fallback' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as fallback,
  ROUND(AVG(openai_base_cost)::numeric, 6) as avg_base_cost,
  ROUND(AVG(cost)::numeric, 4) as avg_final_cost
FROM cv_parsing_usage;
```

## ⚙️ Configuration Required

```env
# Admin API Key (REQUIRED)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-admin-xxxxx

# Profit margin (optional, default: 25%)
PROFIT_MARGIN_PERCENTAGE=25
```

## 🎉 Result

✅ **100% accurate billing** based on real OpenAI costs
✅ **Transparent pricing** - can see real vs fallback
✅ **Category-wise tracking** - CV/Questions/Interviews
✅ **Billing page displays accurate costs**

**Ab sab kuch real OpenAI API se calculate ho raha hai! 🚀**
