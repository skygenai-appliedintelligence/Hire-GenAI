# Removed Selected Agents Page

## Summary
Removed the `/selected-agents` page and all references to it from the application. The workflow now redirects directly to the jobs list after job creation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Job Creation Flow (`app\dashboard\jobs\new\page.tsx`)
**Before:**
- After creating job → Redirect to `/selected-agents?jobId=[id]&tab=1`
- Store selectedAgents in localStorage

**After:**
- After creating job → Redirect to `/dashboard/jobs`
- Store minimal job data in localStorage
- Users can edit interview configuration directly in the job form

**Lines Changed:**
```typescript
// Old:
router.push(`/selected-agents?jobId=${encodeURIComponent(finalJobId)}&tab=1`)

// New:
router.push('/dashboard/jobs')
```

### 2. Jobs List Page (`app\dashboard\jobs\page.tsx`)
**Before:**
- "Continue with Agents" button → Redirect to `/selected-agents?jobId=[id]`
- Store job data for selected-agents page

**After:**
- "Continue with Agents" button → Redirect to `/dashboard/jobs/new?jobId=[id]&tab=interview`
- Opens job editor directly on interview tab
- Users can configure agents within the job form

**Lines Changed:**
```typescript
// Old:
router.push(`/selected-agents?jobId=${encodeURIComponent(job.id)}`)

// New:
router.push(`/dashboard/jobs/new?jobId=${encodeURIComponent(job.id)}&tab=interview`)
```

### 3. Agent Selection Page (`app\dashboard\agents\create\page.tsx`)
**Before:**
- After selecting agents → Redirect to `/selected-agents`

**After:**
- After selecting agents → Redirect to `/dashboard/jobs`
- Returns to jobs list

**Lines Changed:**
```typescript
// Old:
router.push('/selected-agents')

// New:
router.push('/dashboard/jobs')
```

### 4. AI Question Generator Modal (`components\ai-question-generator-modal.tsx`)
**Before:**
- Updated URL with `ai=1&agent=[id]&task=[id]` parameters
- Used basePath to construct URLs
- Managed URL state for selected-agents page

**After:**
- Removed URL manipulation logic
- Simplified modal behavior
- No longer manages URL parameters
- Modal works independently without URL state

**Lines Removed:**
- URL update logic on modal open
- URL cleanup logic on modal close
- Router.push calls
- Console logging for URL changes

## New Workflow

### Job Creation
1. User fills job form (`/dashboard/jobs/new`)
2. Navigates through tabs: Basic → Requirements → ... → Interview
3. On Interview tab, user:
   - Selects interview agents
   - Expands agent card
   - Clicks "Generate Questions" to create AI questions
   - Edits/customizes questions as needed
4. Clicks "Create Job & Setup Agents"
5. **Redirects to `/dashboard/jobs`**

### Job Editing
1. User goes to Jobs List (`/dashboard/jobs`)
2. Clicks "Continue with Agents" on existing job
3. **Opens job editor at Interview tab** (`/dashboard/jobs/new?jobId=[id]&tab=interview`)
4. User can modify interview configuration
5. Saves changes
6. Returns to jobs list
