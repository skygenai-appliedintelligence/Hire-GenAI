---

## 🔄 Integration Points

### 1. CV Parsing Integration ✅

**File:** `app/api/resumes/parse/route.ts`

**What Was Added:**
- Tracks company_id and job_id from the application
- Records CV parsing usage after successful parse
- Captures file size, parse success status, and success rate

**Billing Trigger:**
```typescript
// After successful CV parsing
await DatabaseService.recordCVParsingUsage({
  companyId: companyIdForBilling,
  jobId: jobIdForBilling,
  candidateId: candidateId || undefined,
  fileSizeKb: Math.round(file.size / 1024),
  parseSuccessful: true,
  successRate: parsed.skills && parsed.skills.length > 0 ? 95 : 80
})
```

**When It Triggers:**
- ✅ When a candidate uploads their resume during job application
- ✅ When a recruiter uploads a CV for a candidate
- ✅ When CV is parsed via the API

**Cost:** $0.50 per CV

---

### 2. Question Generation Integration ✅

**File:** `app/api/ai/generate-questions/route.ts`

**What Was Added:**
- Accepts companyId and jobId parameters
- Estimates token usage based on job description length and number of questions
- Records question generation usage after AI call

**Billing Trigger:**
```typescript
// After questions are generated
const estimatedPromptTokens = Math.round(jobDescription.length / 4) + (numberOfQuestions * 100)
const estimatedCompletionTokens = questions.length * 50

await DatabaseService.recordQuestionGenerationUsage({
  companyId,
  jobId,
  promptTokens: estimatedPromptTokens,
  completionTokens: estimatedCompletionTokens,
  questionCount: questions.length,
  modelUsed: 'gpt-4o'
})
```

**When It Triggers:**
- ✅ When creating a new job and generating interview questions
- ✅ When regenerating questions for an existing job
- ✅ When AI generates questions via the API

**Cost:** $0.002 per 1,000 tokens

**Token Estimation:**
- Prompt tokens: Job description length ÷ 4 + (100 × number of questions)
- Completion tokens: 50 × number of questions generated

---

### 3. Video Interview Integration ✅

**File:** `app/api/applications/[applicationId]/interview-status/route.ts`

**What Was Added:**
- Calculates interview duration from start to completion time
- Fetches company_id and job_id from the interview record
- Records video interview usage after completion

**Billing Trigger:**
```typescript
// After interview is marked as completed
const durationToRecord = Math.max(1, Math.round(duration_minutes || 1))

await DatabaseService.recordVideoInterviewUsage({
  companyId: company_id,
  jobId: job_id,
  interviewId: interviewId,
  durationMinutes: durationToRecord,
  completedQuestions: 0,
  totalQuestions: 0,
  videoQuality: 'HD'
})
```

**When It Triggers:**
- ✅ When a candidate completes a video interview
- ✅ When interview status is marked as completed
