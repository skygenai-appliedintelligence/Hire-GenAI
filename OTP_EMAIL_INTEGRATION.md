# OTP Email Integration

## Overview
Successfully integrated email delivery for OTP verification codes that were previously only shown in console logs. Now users receive professional HTML emails with their verification codes.

## What Changed

### 1. Created OTP Email Service (`lib/otp-email-service.ts`)
- **Signup OTP Email**: Welcome email with verification code and security notes
- **Login OTP Email**: Sign-in verification with different styling for demo vs regular mode
- **Professional HTML Templates**: Responsive design with proper branding
- **Security Features**: Clear expiration time and security warnings

### 2. Updated OTP API Endpoints

#### Signup OTP (`/api/otp/send/route.ts`)
- ✅ Sends professional welcome email with OTP
- ✅ Fallback to console logging if email fails
- ✅ Includes user's full name and company info

#### Login OTP (`/api/otp/send-login/route.ts`)
- ✅ Sends sign-in verification email
- ✅ Different templates for demo vs regular login
- ✅ Handles both database and mock auth service modes
- ✅ Fallback to console logging if email fails

### 3. Email Templates

#### Signup Email Features:
- Welcome message with user's name
- Large, clear OTP display
- 10-minute expiration notice
- Security warnings about not sharing codes
- Professional HireGenAI branding

#### Login Email Features:
- Welcome back message
- Demo mode indicator (if applicable)
- Clear OTP display with different colors
- Security notes appropriate for login context
- Professional styling

## How It Works

### Flow for Signup:
1. User enters email, name, company on signup form
2. System creates OTP challenge in database
3. **NEW**: System sends professional email with OTP code
4. User receives email and enters OTP to verify
5. If email fails, OTP is logged to console as fallback

### Flow for Login:
1. User enters email and selects demo/regular mode
2. System validates user exists (for regular mode)
3. System creates OTP challenge
4. **NEW**: System sends sign-in email with OTP code
5. User receives email and enters OTP to sign in
6. If email fails, OTP is logged to console as fallback

## Testing

### Test Page: `/test-otp-email`
- Interactive form to test both signup and login OTP emails
- Separate tabs for signup vs login testing
- Shows API responses and debug information
- Includes demo mode toggle for login testing

### Manual Testing:
1. Visit `http://localhost:3000/test-otp-email`
2. Fill in email and other required fields
3. Click "Send Signup OTP" or "Send Login OTP"
4. Check your email inbox for the verification code
5. Verify the email looks professional and contains the OTP

## Environment Requirements

Make sure these are set in your `.env.local`:
```env
SMTP_HOST=smtp.hostinger.com
SMTP_PORT=465
SMTP_SECURE=true
SMTP_USER=support@hire-genai.com
SMTP_PASS=SKYnet@12345
EMAIL_FROM="HireGenAI <support@hire-genai.com>"
```

## Fallback Behavior

If email sending fails (SMTP issues, network problems, etc.):
- ✅ System continues to work normally
- ✅ OTP is logged to console as backup
- ✅ User can still complete verification process
- ✅ Error is logged for debugging

## Production Considerations

### Security:
- ✅ OTP codes expire in 10 minutes
- ✅ Emails include security warnings
- ✅ No sensitive data in email logs
- ✅ Professional appearance builds trust

### Reliability:
- ✅ Graceful fallback to console logging
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Works with both database and mock auth modes
- ✅ Consistent behavior across signup/login flows

### User Experience:
- ✅ Professional, branded emails
- ✅ Clear instructions and expectations
- ✅ Mobile-friendly responsive design
- ✅ Appropriate messaging for different contexts

## Integration Points

### Existing Signup Flow:
- `http://localhost:3000/signup?section=admin` now sends email
- Console logging still works as fallback
- No changes needed to frontend verification forms

### Existing Login Flow:
- Demo and regular login both send emails
- Different email templates for different modes
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Files Modified:
- ✅ `lib/otp-email-service.ts` - New email service
- ✅ `app/api/otp/send/route.ts` - Added email sending to signup
- ✅ `app/api/otp/send-login/route.ts` - Added email sending to login
- ✅ `app/test-otp-email/page.tsx` - New testing interface

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE

The OTP verification system now sends professional emails instead of just console logs, while maintaining full backward compatibility and fallback behavior.
